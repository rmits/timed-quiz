When the screen is initially loaded up, it displays the info card, along with a begin button and a high score button as well that would get rid of the info card on the screen, and pull up the leaderboard card. When begin is clicked, it will hide the info card, and run the timer and score function, as well as the quiz function that goes through an array of objects with questions, answers and the correct answer. If the correct answer is chosen, the score is increased by 100. If the wrong answer is selected, then the timer will go down by 20 seconds.

Once the quiz is finished, it will hide the quiz card and bring up the end of quiz card, where you type your name and then submit, and that username and the score are logged into local storage, and then the user is brought back to the main menu
